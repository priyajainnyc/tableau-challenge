Homework 18 for the tableau challenge module of Datavis bootcamp

## Project Description
Thankful for my new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicise and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the ["Citi Bike Data" webpage](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data/).

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

I've provided six interactive dashboards, each with at least three visualizations, converted into a story to show the following data:  
  
**Dashboard Visualizations Organized In A Story**
- Citi Bike Analysis Summary 2022
- Start Station Charts Filtered By Month 2022
- End Station Charts Filterd by Month 2022
- Weekly Analysis of Type of Bike Rides Filtered by Month 2022
- Seasonal Analysis  of Bike Type 2022
- Ridership Growth By Membership Type 2022  

**Installation**
- Clone this repo and save it in your local directory
- git clone `https://github.com/priyajainnyc/tableau-challenge`
- Open the repo in a code editor to see the codes used to clean and merge the data from the Citi Bike Data webpage within the following Jupyter file 'citi_bike_data.ipynb', and export the following csv data file 'citi_bike_merged2.csv' under the Resources folder within the repo. CSV files may be too large for GitHub to upload.
- Visit [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/priya.jain1057/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis2022/CitiBikeAnalysis2022) in your browser, and you may also refer to images of the each of the six dashboards in the Images folder and the Tableau workbook "Citi Bike Analysis 2022.twbx' within the repo.
